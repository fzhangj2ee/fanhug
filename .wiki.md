# Project Summary
PayApp is a secure payment web application designed for seamless payment processing and live sports betting. Users can register and log in using traditional email/password or social media accounts (Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). The platform features an intuitive payment interface integrated with Stripe for efficient transactions. Recent enhancements include a localStorage-based architecture replacing Supabase and integration with The Odds API for real-time betting features, offering live odds data from major sportsbooks. The interface resembles a professional sportsbook, displaying betting odds in an American format for improved usability, alongside a robust filtering system and a new left sidebar navigation for easy access to various sports. Automatic grading of bets based on game results enhances user experience by providing real-time updates on bet outcomes.
