# Project Summary
PayApp is a secure payment web application designed to facilitate seamless payment processing for users. It offers registration and login options through traditional email/password methods as well as social media accounts (Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). With a user-friendly payment interface and Stripe integration, PayApp aims to deliver an efficient transaction experience while prioritizing security. The platform has transitioned to a localStorage-based architecture, eliminating the need for Supabase. Recently, it has integrated The Odds API to provide real-time betting features, enhancing user engagement with live odds data from major sportsbooks. The latest update has introduced American odds format for betting, improving usability for users familiar with this system.
