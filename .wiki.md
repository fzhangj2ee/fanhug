# Project Summary
PayApp is a secure payment web application designed to facilitate seamless payment processing for users. It offers registration and login options through traditional email/password methods as well as social media accounts (Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). With a user-friendly payment interface and Stripe integration, PayApp aims to deliver an efficient transaction experience while prioritizing security. The platform has transitioned to a localStorage-based architecture, eliminating the need for Supabase.
