# Project Summary
PayApp is a secure payment web application designed for seamless payment processing and live sports betting. It enables users to register and log in via traditional email/password or social media accounts (Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). The platform features an intuitive payment interface integrated with Stripe for efficient transactions. Recent enhancements include a localStorage-based architecture that replaces Supabase and integration with The Odds API for real-time betting features, offering users live odds data from major sportsbooks. The interface is styled to emulate a professional sportsbook, displaying betting odds in an American format for improved usability, along with a robust filtering system and a new left sidebar navigation for easy access to various sports.
