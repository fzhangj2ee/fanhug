# Project Summary
PayApp is a secure payment web application that facilitates seamless payment processing and live sports betting. Users can register and log in using traditional email/password methods or through OAuth2 social media accounts like Google and Facebook. The platform features an intuitive payment interface integrated with Stripe for secure transactions. Recent enhancements include a localStorage-based architecture, replacing Supabase, and integration with The Odds API for real-time betting features. The user interface mimics a professional sportsbook, showcasing betting odds in American format and providing a robust filtering system with a new left sidebar navigation for easy access to various sports. Automatic grading of bets based on game results enhances user experience with real-time updates on bet outcomes. The navbar has been updated to include login/logout buttons, improving user accessibility to the authentication system. The project now successfully integrates with Supabase for user authentication.
